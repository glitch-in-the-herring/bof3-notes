It is important to distinguish the directions and positions when talking about navigation and positions, as this game, unlike Breath of Fire IV, does not have a compass HUD or a 360° camera.
* North means the direction the character travels when pushing up on the-pad
* South means the direction the character travels when pushing down on the-pad
* West means the direction the character travels when pushing left on the-pad
* East means the direction the character travels when pushing right on the-pad
