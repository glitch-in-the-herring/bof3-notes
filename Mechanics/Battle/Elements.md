Related to the concept of [[Resistance]] are Elements.
As bit switches:

| Bit    | Type    |
| ------ | ------- |
| `0x01` | Fire    |
| `0x02` | Ice     |
| `0x04` | Thunder |
| `0x08` | Earth   |
| `0x10` | Wind    |
| `0x20` | Holy    |
| `0x40` | Psionic |
| `0x80` | Status  |
Surprisingly, Death is not its own element like in Breath of Fire IV. Elements from Fire to Wind are referred to as "magic elements" in this guide, as these are the only resistances considered by the [[Magic Formula]].
